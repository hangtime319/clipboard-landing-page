# Clipboard Landing Page

A responsive landing page for a fictional clipboard application, built as a challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Description

This is a solution to the "Clipboard landing page" challenge. The project's main goal was to create a modern and fully responsive single-page website that showcases the features of a mobile and desktop clipboard management app. The focus was on building a clean layout with distinct sections, displaying images and text, and ensuring the design looks great on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure and content of the page.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For all the styling, including advanced layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid, responsive design with media queries, and animations for hover effects.
* **JavaScript (optional):** Minimal or no JavaScript was required for this challenge, as the focus is on a static landing page design. Any minor interactive elements are likely handled with pure CSS.

## Installation

This is a static website, so there's no need for complex setup or dependencies. Simply follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hangtime319/clipboard-landing-page.git](https://github.com/hangtime319/clipboard-landing-page.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of a well-structured landing page. It features:
* A hero section with a call-to-action.
* Sections detailing the app's features with images and text.
* A dedicated section for syncing across devices.
* A partners/brands section.
* A footer with social media links.
* A design that is fully responsive.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** The layout automatically adjusts to fit mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* **Clean Layout:** The use of Flexbox and Grid creates a well-organized and easy-to-read page structure.
* **Icon and Image Integration:** The page seamlessly integrates various icons and screenshots to enhance the user experience.
* **Interactive Elements:** Simple hover effects on buttons and links add a touch of interactivity.
